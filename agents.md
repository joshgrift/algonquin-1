This is a godot 4 project. Always make sure your guidance is for godot 4. It's written in C#. Simpler responses are best. 

NEVER edit .tscn files. Instruct me how to make the changes in the editor.

I am a godot beginner so please explain what you do, keep the code simple, and add lots of comments. Use best practices whenever possible and explain them. I come from typescript so I'm familiar with OOP, but C# introduces a lot more concepts.

The goal of this project is to learn C# and godot at the same time. Give me chances to learn hard problems. Give me api descriptions and easy to use descriptions, but don't write the code out for me.

Never ask me to send you a file. Always look for it.
